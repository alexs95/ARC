CT5148 Assignment 3: ARC

Choice of Task
---------------------------------------------------------------
I looked through about 50 - 75 different tasks to decide which ones to implement.
What I found out is that tasks that I found the hardest to solve were ones I could not
figure out the pattern to the solution. However, once I figured out the pattern, I
almost always figured they would be fairly easy to implement.
As examples to this point, these were the tasks I found the hardest to solve:
6d0160f0 - this took one took the longest to figure out, was at it for at least 15 mins
44f52bb0 - still not sure if I what I think the answer to this is correct
68b16354 - convinced myself this one was a bug (looked purely random) before I finally figured it out
6d58a25d - not sure why it took so long but could not figure it out
99b1bc43 - I came up with very imaginative theories on what dictates
           the amount of lines coming out of the triangle

Instead of choosing any of these, the criteria I judged the tasks "difficulty" was how hard
I thought it would be to solve them programmatically.
The main "feel" for this difficulty was when I had to take a minute to figure out what
it is I actually did to come up with a solution. Judging by this criteria, I would consider
much easier to implement. For example, 68b16354 would be to swap rows.


Code structure & GitHub
---------------------------------------------------------------
I did all my work on the assignment branch which I merged to master when I was complete.
The README contains contains comments about the purpose of this fork.

The code is laid out as follows:
  At first there are three classes representing different levels of abstraction
  about objects in the task. These provide an API for querying the input.
  Then each solve_ function with functions that are used in the solutions below
  each solve_ function.


Reflection
---------------------------------------------------------------
I would consider the main similarity between these (and all the other) tasks
pattern matching and interpretation of colors.
All of the challenges require you to figure out (the pattern) a set of transformations
to the input grid by interpreting what the colors mean.
You have a set of examples to figure out this pattern. In my solution the
three classes contain transformations (and also the function downscale if it was
implemented more generally), could potentially be used for more than one task.
The method get_adjacency_collections would be an example of pattern matching.
The actual solutions would in a way contain the interpretation of the colors.

Similarities:
Interpretation: All three solutions had a concept of a "background" on which
stuff was happening.

Pattern matching: All three required understanding of the idea of the significance of
cells of equal being color next to each other.

Transformation: 0e206a2e and required understanding geometrical transformation concepts
(but the transformations themselves were different).

Differences:
The most obvious difference is that the pattern to solve each task was different.

There was a concept of a path in b782dc8a.


Relationship to Chollet paper
---------------------------------------------------------------
Sadly as this was our second last assignment I was really stuck for time (could not start as soon
as I liked as I had to finish previous ones). I only had a chance to skim through the paper so
this section might be taken with a pinch of salt.. possibly a lot of salt.
I did want to give it a go. I will read it over Christmas properly for sure,
I found it very interesting!

My interpretation of the goal of ARC dataset is to provide a dataset that if solved would represent
a more general artificial intelligence. It explains how state of the art applications of machine
learning are usually very specific to one narrow task, e.g. playing Go or chess,
but are not generally intelligent. The ARC dataset sets out to contain general
tasks that would need to be a solved by an AI that is more generally intelligent.
The Chollet paper describes a set of priors that an entity can have to solve
these general tasks. I am thinking these would correspond to the similarities
in my solutions. For example the concept of rotating, moving, recognising squares
etc. This would loosely correspond to the three classes at the start of my solution.
The actual solve_ functions would correspond to the use of these priors to solve the
tasks, I guess this is what the AI would actually need to have understand.

    to solve as a human (in comparison to others) but also the real difficulty was that
    even after thinking about it for a while, I was not fully sure of the exact steps
    I took in my head to solve it.

    The steps in my head for solving it are:
    1. Find the shape(s) and the "dots" that the shapes need to be placed on.
    2. Figure out which shape belongs to which set of "dots".
    3. Move the shape(s) into the correct position, judging it by the dots.
    4. Remove the old position of the shape(s).


    Algorithm:
    1. The pattern here was that shapes would need to be connected by at least
    one neighbour on the horizontal or vertical. The way I figured out the
    reference "dots" was by creating sets of that that were closest together,
    my metric for closest was summed distance.
    2. I brute forced this, just tried every possible combination
    of shape and set of "dots".
    3. Move actually corresponded to transform.. you could also rotate, or flip
    before moving. Also brute forced this step by trying all possibilities
    of rotating and flipping until I found any match.
    4. This was easily done by starting with a blank canvas for the solution.
